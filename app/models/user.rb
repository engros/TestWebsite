# before_save
# presence: true , constraint making sure that name cannot be empty before going to database (must be present)
# length: { maximum: 50 } , constraint to limit characters
# VALID_EMAIL_REGEX = /\A[\w+\-.]+@[a-z\d\-.]+\.[a-z]+\z/i , constant containing pragmatic regex for matching email addresses according to the official email standard
# format: { with: VALID_EMAIL_REGEX } , ensures that only email addresses that match the pattern will be considered valid.
# uniqueness: true, emails should not have duplicates.
# uniqueness: { case_sensitive: false }, turns off case-sensitivity so emails such as FOOBAR@example.com is the same as foobar@example.com. Rails infer that uniqueness also must be true.
# has_secure_password, ses a state-of-the-art hash function called bcrypt. By hashing the password with bcrypt, we ensure that an attacker wonâ€™t be able to log in to the site even if they manage to obtain a copy of the database.
# validates :password, presence: true, length: { minimum: 6 } , set minimum password to 6 characters
